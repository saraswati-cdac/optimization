This version implements a database-based quantum circuit optimizer.
It builds a small lookup table of unitaries (matrices) and their shortest equivalent circuits, then uses that database 
to simplify input circuits by replacing them with shorter versions that perform the same operation.
V2_lib.py introduces a deterministic, database-based quantum circuit optimizer — an improvement over V1, which used random search.
It’s more structured and reproducible but limited to single-qubit circuits and small gate sets.

Defines a tiny gate library with only Hadamard (H) and Pauli-X gates.

Operates on single-qubit circuits.


* The lookup table (a Python dictionary in your code) stores:

Key: the unitary matrix (converted to bytes)

Value: the shortest circuit that produces that unitary

So it’s like a ready-made dictionary of known transformations and their simplest versions.
