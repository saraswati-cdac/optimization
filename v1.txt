 * It tries to simplify (reduce) a given quantum circuit by randomly selecting subsequences of gates and checking 
    if they can be replaced by shorter equivalent subsequences — effectively doing circuit compression by random search.
 * random_subsequence(circuit, length)

Selects a random slice (start and end indices) of a given circuit’s gate list.

* is_equivalent(circ1, circ2, tol=1e-5)

Compares two circuits by checking if their unitary matrices are equivalent up to global phase, using qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.

random_search_reduce(circuit, max_iters=20)

Core reduction loop:

Randomly picks subsequences of gates (2–5 long).

Builds a smaller candidate (either empty or a few random CX/CZ gates).

If the candidate is unitarily equivalent to the subsequence, it replaces the original subsequence with the candidate.

Logs every successful replacement.

Runs for up to max_iters iterations or until the circuit becomes too small.



* Run:
Creates a 7-qubit test circuit with several redundant cx (CNOT) gates.

Prints the original circuit depth.

Calls random_search_reduce(qc, max_iters=30) to reduce it.

Prints the reduced circuit depth and both circuit structures.

Displays a visual comparison using the function from V1_lib.py.
